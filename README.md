# Java Banking System 2 - Online Shop

This project extends the simple banking system with an online shop, allowing customers to purchase and refund items using their bank account. It tests your understanding of objects, collections, and interaction between classes.

## ðŸ§© The Task

You must **implement the missing logic** in the following file:

- `OnlineShop.java`

Look for the `TODO` comments in each file. The unit tests in `OnlineShopTest.java` will check that:

- Items can be added to a user's cart.
- Orders can be placed if the customer has enough balance.
- Money is transferred from the buyer to the shop owner.
- Refunds work only for items that were actually bought.
- Edge cases (e.g. refunding unbought items or overspending) are handled correctly.

The shop is pre-filled with three items:
- Spezi â€“ 20â‚¬
- Cola â€“ 30â‚¬
- Sprite â€“ 25â‚¬

### Run command
`gradle test` (or `./gradlew test`)
